Not much has changed, but translation files for PDFStitcher have been updated for French, German, Dutch, and Spanish. Many thanks to the volunteer translators who took the time to help make PDFStitcher more accessible.

The links on the [home](/) and [download](/docs/download) pages have been updated to point to the new release. As always, please let me know if there are any issues through the [bug tracker](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher/issues).
