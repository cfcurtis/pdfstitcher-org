As a primarily one-person open source project, I am always looking for help improving PDFStitcher. There are a number of ways you can contribute:

## Translations
PDFStitcher has been translated into French, German, Spanish, and Dutch. Help make it more accessible by contributing a translation! Translation is done using [gettext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html), and you can learn more about how to edit translation files [here](/docs/translate).

## Bug reports
Do you have an idea for a new feature, or have you found a bug? Let me know by submitting a bug report to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher/issues).

## Website
This website, like the software, is in the early stages of development and could be improved with your help! Would you like to expand on the [documentation](/docs/)? Are you a graphics designer who has a better logo idea? This website is also [open source](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher-org).

## Programming
If you'd like to tackle an [issue](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher/issues) yourself or add a new feature, feel free to checkout the code from [github](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher) and submit a pull request. If you're new to working with GitHub, you can read more about pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).

## Donate via PayPal
You can also [buy me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=SUA34ZEE6H35G&item_name=Support+PDFStitcher&currency_code=CAD) to support ongoing development.
