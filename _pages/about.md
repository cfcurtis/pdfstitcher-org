PDFStitcher was developed in late 2020 to help sewists convert print-at-home PDF sewing patterns into a single large file suitable for use with a projector. Just like printing and taping together a paper pattern, PDFStitcher takes the specified page range, amount to trim from each page, and number of rows or columns and assembles the pages together to form a complete pattern. 

PDFStitcher is 100% free and open source software licensed under the [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) written in Python and bundled into executables for Windows and Mac.

## Acknowledgements

PDFStitcher has been developed and tested with the help of many wonderful and patient volunteers at the [Projectors for Sewing](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ProjectorsForSewing) Facebook group. This is the place to learn about sewing with projectors, so if you're interested in moving away from paper patterns, check it out. I would especially like to thank those who contributed translations, documentation, constructive feedback, and donations to my fabric fund. If you're interested in contributing, learn more [here](/docs/contribute/).

PDFStitcher is built using a number of other open source tools, including:
- [pikepdf](https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf)
- [wxpython](https://www.wxpython.org/)
- [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)
