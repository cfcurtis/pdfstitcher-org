PDFStitcher is written in Python and bundled into executables for Windows and Mac. It does not need to be installed; just download and run.

## Windows
[<i class='fas fa-download'></i> Download for Windows]({{ site.latest-windows }}){: .btn .btn--primary }

PDFStitcher should run on Windows 7 or newer. If your system blocks you from opening it, try [adding a security exclusion](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) or [following these instructions](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-app-has-been-blocked-your-protection-windows-10).

## macOS
[<i class='fas fa-download'></i> Download for Mac]({{ site.latest-mac }}){: .btn .btn--primary }

If you're using a Mac, PDFStitcher will only run on OS X High Sierra or newer. Additionally, you may get a warning that you are trying to open an app from an unidentified developer. Please see [this article](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40616) for instructions on how to override this warning.
