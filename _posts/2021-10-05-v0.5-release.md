After spending far too long in beta status, PDFStitcher v0.5 is officially the recommended version. Most of the improvements are behind the scenes - improved handling of different file structures, better error handling, etc.

In addition to the changes introduced in the [beta version](/v0.5-beta/), the following small tweaks might be of interest:

- Removed a debug flag that was causing potentially inflated file sizes
- New Czech translation files (thanks to [Lucie Hol√°](https://www.facebook.com/Nerdlenka-101673075579445), who also created a new [Czech projector sewing group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/668336430797317/)!)
- Explicit UI change to enforce only number of rows OR columns. This has always been how PDFStitcher functions, but it defaulted to choosing columns if the numbers didn't line up - now it only lets you type in one or the other.
- Fix to handle files from OpenOffice Draw, which had some unusual PDF properties resulting in a PDFStitcher output file with a dimension of 0
- Adding a note to the user to check if the file is open in another program rather than relying on the obscure "Error 13" message
- Windows executable is built with [pikepdf](https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf) v3.1.0, macOS still on v2.15.0 due to issues with my super old mac build

## Translations

As usual, translation files lag a bit behind the development. It will still work in your supported language, but the occasional message or label may show up in English as a result of changes. If you'd like to fix a translation, please see [this page](/docs/translate/).
